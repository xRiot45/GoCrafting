cd your-repo
```

Download dependencies:

```
go mod tidy
```

---

### Configuration

Copy environment file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit values as needed.

---

### Running the Application

```
go run cmd/app/main.go
```

Or:

```
make run
```

---

## Environment Variables

Example `.env` file:

```
APP_NAME=go-service
APP_ENV=development
APP_PORT=8080

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=app_db

JWT_SECRET=supersecret
```

---

## Build

Build binary:

```
go build -o bin/app cmd/app/main.go
```

Run binary:

```
./bin/app
```

---

## Testing

```
go test ./...
```

Run with coverage:

```
go test ./... -cover
```

---

```
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

Example response:

```
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

---

## Logging

Example structured logging configuration using zap or logrus.

Log levels:

* debug
* info
* warn
* error

---

## Deployment

Example deployment steps:

1. Build binary
2. Copy `.env`
3. Run service
4. Configure reverse proxy

---

## Docker

Build image:

```
docker build -t go-app .
```

Run container:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 go-app
```

---

## Makefile Commands

make run
make build
make test
make lint
```

---

## CI/CD

Example pipeline steps:

* Install dependencies
* Run tests
* Build binary
* Build Docker image
* Deploy

---

## Performance Considerations

* Use connection pooling
* Avoid unnecessary allocations
* Use context properly
* Benchmark critical paths

---

## Security

* Validate all inputs
* Store secrets in environment variables
* Use HTTPS
* Sanitize database queries
* Implement rate limiting

---

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

**Port already in use**

```
lsof -i :8080
```

**Module issues**

```
go clean -modcache
```

---
